The MAC address format consists of 48 bits, typically represented as 12 hexadecimal digits grouped into six pairs. Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits, and a byte is made up of eight bits. Here's a breakdown of the MAC address format:

1. **Total Length:**
   - A MAC address is 48 bits long, divided into six groups of 8 bits each, forming six bytes.

2. **Hexadecimal Representation:**
   - Each group of 8 bits is represented by two hexadecimal digits. Hexadecimal is a base-16 numbering system, and the digits used are 0-9 and A-F (where A represents 10, B is 11, and so on up to F representing 15).

3. **Colon-Delimited Pairs:**
   - The hexadecimal pairs are usually separated by colons (e.g., `01:23:45:67:89:ab`). This colon-separated format is a common convention but is not strictly required.

4. **Example:**
   - An example MAC address is `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`. Breaking it down into bytes:
     - Byte 1: `00` (hexadecimal)
     - Byte 2: `1A` (hexadecimal)
     - Byte 3: `2B` (hexadecimal)
     - Byte 4: `3C` (hexadecimal)
     - Byte 5: `4D` (hexadecimal)
     - Byte 6: `5E` (hexadecimal)

5. **OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier):**
   - The first three pairs of the MAC address (first 24 bits) represent the OUI. The OUI is assigned by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and identifies the manufacturer or vendor of the network interface card.

6. **Locally Administered Bit:**
   - The least significant bit of the first byte (bit 1 of the first hexadecimal digit) is the "Locally Administered" bit. If this bit is set to `1`, it indicates that the MAC address has been locally administered (assigned by the user or administrator) rather than being globally unique.

In summary, the MAC address format is a sequence of 48 bits represented by six pairs of hexadecimal digits. The format provides a structured way to uniquely identify network interfaces on a local network, with the first three pairs indicating the manufacturer and the remaining three pairs uniquely identifying the device.

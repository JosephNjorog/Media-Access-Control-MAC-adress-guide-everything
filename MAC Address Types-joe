### MAC Address Types:

1. **Unicast MAC Address:**
   - **Definition:**
     - A unicast MAC address is used to uniquely identify a single device on the network.
   - **Example:**
     - `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

2. **Multicast MAC Address:**
   - **Definition:**
     - A multicast MAC address is used to represent a group of devices. Frames sent to a multicast address are received by all devices in the group.
   - **Example:**
     - `01:00:5E:01:01:01`

3. **Broadcast MAC Address:**
   - **Definition:**
     - A broadcast MAC address is used to send frames to all devices on the network segment.
   - **Example:**
     - `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`

4. **Locally Administered vs. Globally Unique:**
   - **Globally Unique Address:**
     - Assigned by the manufacturer and registered with the IEEE OUI database. Used for devices that need a globally unique identifier.
   - **Locally Administered Address:**
     - Assigned by the user or administrator for specific purposes, not registered globally. Can be used for testing, configuration, or privacy.

5. **EUI-64:**
   - **Definition:**
     - The Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-64) is a type of MAC address used in IPv6 networks. It's derived from the 48-bit MAC address, typically by inserting additional bits to create a 64-bit identifier.

Understanding these aspects of MAC addresses is crucial for effective network management, troubleshooting, and ensuring secure and efficient communication within a network.

A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on a network. Here are key aspects about MAC addresses:

1. **Format:**
   - A MAC address is a 48-bit (6-byte) identifier typically represented as a series of six pairs of hexadecimal digits (e.g., `01:23:45:67:89:ab`).

2. **Uniqueness:**
   - MAC addresses are theoretically unique worldwide. Manufacturers assign unique MAC addresses to network interface cards (NICs) during production.

3. **OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier):**
   - The first 24 bits (first three pairs) of a MAC address represent the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI), which identifies the manufacturer or vendor of the NIC.

4. **Locally Administered vs. Globally Unique:**
   - A MAC address can be globally unique (assigned by the manufacturer) or locally administered (set by the user or system administrator). The least significant bit of the first byte indicates whether the MAC address is locally administered (`1`) or globally unique (`0`).

5. **Usage in Networking:**
